# Building My Own Redis

## What will I be building currently?

- Binding to a TCP port and listening for connections
- Responding to basic commands like `PING` and `ECHO`
- Parsing the Redis Protocol (RESP) from client requests
- Handling multiple clients concurrently
- Implementing the SET and GET commands to store and retrieve data.

Note: This is a challenge from [codecrafters.io](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/redis/overview)
